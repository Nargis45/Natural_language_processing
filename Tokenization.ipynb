This is one of the famous inspirational quotes of the great and successful American scientist Albert Einstein. I think that you all would have heard of this great physicist and his discoveries in the field of science. His discovery of the theory of relativity has been a significant contribution to physics. He was not good in all subjects but was greatly interested in mathematics and physics. He was called a child genius because he was capable of solving hard problems of mathematics at a very small age. He had poor performance in subjects other than mathematics and physics; therefore he was disliked by his schools.He had a different perspective towards nature and its phenomenon. His mind was full of curiosity and thus he was always interested in doing and knowing about new things. He had a child-like curiosity even after he grew older and this was the greatest reason behind the discoveries of his scientific theories.\""
